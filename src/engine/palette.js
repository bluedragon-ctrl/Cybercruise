// Central colour palette — cyberpunk "old green phosphor monitor" aesthetic.
//
// The WORLD (road, buildings, scenery) and all UI TEXT are shades of neon
// green, to evoke an 80s green CRT terminal. GAMEPLAY ENTITIES instead get
// distinct accent colours so they stand out against the green background:
//   - player  -> cyan (+ magenta thrusters)
//   - enemies -> red        (added in a later phase)
//   - neutral -> amber      (added in a later phase)
//
// Keep new world/scenery colours as greens here so the whole game stays
// coherent from one file.

// --- World / UI: green phosphor family ---
export const GREEN = "#39ff88";        // primary neon green (barriers, building edges)
export const GREEN_BRIGHT = "#7dffb0"; // brighter readouts / emphasis
export const GREEN_PALE = "#b6ffcc";   // pale green (lane dashes, secondary text, labels)
export const GREEN_DIM = "#1f8f52";    // muted green (faint fills / far scenery)
export const ROADSIDE_FILL = "rgba(30,120,70,0.12)"; // faint green ground OUTSIDE the road
                                                     // (the road surface itself stays black)

// --- Gameplay entity accents ---
export const PLAYER = "#39f6ff";        // player car (cyan)
export const PLAYER_THRUST = "#ff36c8"; // player thruster glow (magenta)
export const HAZARD = "#ff4d4d";        // damage / collision flash (red)
